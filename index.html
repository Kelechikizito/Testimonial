                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp, I've been looking to make
                a <br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I 
                signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled 
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>weeks was the best- and most grueling - time of my
                life. Since completing the course, I've <br>successfully switched careers, working as 
                a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

        <p class="text-kira">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some
            structure from professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step.
            I was encouraged <br> to enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say 
            wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br>
            dissapoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance
            . The agile team project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to
            the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I've often 
            referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>development experience.It 
            certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>
            offers. 100% recommend! "
